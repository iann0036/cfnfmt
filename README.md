# cfnfmt

> :construction: WORK IN PROGRESS

cfnfmt is an AWS CloudFormation template style formatter. It identifies and corrects things like line spacing and other items which could be considered personal preference. It does not check or determine the validity of resource property syntax, for that you should use [cfn-lint](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint).

## Installation

```
npm i -g cfnfmt
```

## Usage

TBD
